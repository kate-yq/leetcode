Given an m x n integer matrix, search for a target int.

return true/false

the matrix is sorted as follows:
for each row - ascending order
for each col - ascending order

no relationships between end of a row and beginning of next row
.... end of a col and beginning of next col

example:
1   3   5   7   9
4   8  10  11  12

target: 8
return true
