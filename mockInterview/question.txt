Given an m x n binary matrix mat, return the distance of the nearest 0 for each cell.

The distance between two adjacent cells is 1.

0 0 0
0 1 0
1 1 1

return:
distance to nearest 0

0 0 0
0 1 0
1 2 1

1. possible to be all 0, not possible to be all 1
2. move 4 directions
3. 1 <= m,n <= 10^4
    m*n <= 10^4
